# GooglePlusPlusHideComments

The `googleplusplus_hide_comments` userscript Adds a Hide Comments or Show Comments link on each post; this feature is sticky (the hidden or shown state is recorded in the browser's local storage).

So far, this userscript was tested in Google Chrome 12 and Firefox 5 (on OS X).

This is experimental, alpha quality code.

Feedback is welcome.
