# GooglePlusPlus Hide Comments

## General Information
The `googleplusplus_hide_comments` userscript for Google Plus adds a Hide Comments or Show Comments link on each post; this feature is sticky (the hidden or shown state is recorded in the browser's local storage).

So far, this userscript was tested in Google Chrome 12 and Firefox 5 (on OS X).

This is experimental, alpha quality code.

Feedback is welcome.

## Alternate Versions

The _build.rb build script creates alternate script versions. There is currently one alt version, "top", which puts the Hide Comments link at the top. The two scripts work exactly the same in all other ways.

***Install Alternate Version "top" - Places Hide Comments link on top"***: <http://go.wittman.org/auzv>

The scripts are named, namespaced and versioned exactly the same so installing one over-writes a previous primary or alt version. In the description will be an ALTERNATE VERSION clause only in an alt script.
